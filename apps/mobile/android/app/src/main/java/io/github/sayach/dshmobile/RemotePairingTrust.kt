 * passthrough entry has no public certificate: it publishes its ingress CA at
 * `/mobile-access/ca.cer`, and that CA is exactly the fingerprint the pairing key carries.
 * It must therefore be pinned the same way the LAN path already pins its pairing CA.
 *
 * The three outcomes are deliberately separated, because only two of them are legitimate:
 *  - a served CA that matches the pairing key is pinned;
 *  - an explicit 404 keeps the platform trust store only for a dsh1 public-CA key;
 *  - a dsh2 key with no CA, or a mismatched served CA, is a hard identity mismatch.
