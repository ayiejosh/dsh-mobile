# Self-hosted FRP guide

[中文指南](SELF_HOSTED_FRP.md)

This page covers the released managed deployment, in which the plugin installs frps and Caddy. Attaching to an frps you already operate is part of the **unreleased 0.4.6 candidate**; the published 0.4.5 plugin and app do not contain that entry. See the [candidate attachment guide](ATTACH_EXISTING_FRPS.en.md).

Self-hosted FRP is for users who already operate a VPS and want to avoid the bandwidth limits of public tunnels. The phone reaches Caddy on the VPS over HTTPS, crosses the encrypted FRP tunnel, and then reaches DSH on the computer. FRP only transports the request; DSH pairing is still required.

```text
Android app
  -> HTTPS (domain or public IPv4)
  -> Caddy on the VPS
  -> 127.0.0.1:7080 (frps HTTP vhost, loopback only)
  -> encrypted FRP tunnel
  -> computer running DSH
```

## Two entry modes

- **Domain mode**: use your own public domain; Caddy obtains and renews the certificate automatically.
- **Public IPv4 mode**: use the VPS public IPv4 address directly. The plugin uses Certbot to request a roughly six-day Let's Encrypt IP certificate and installs a daily renewal timer. Documentation ranges such as `203.0.113.10`, private addresses, and other reserved addresses are rejected; enter a real routable public IP.

The publicly trusted entry in this guide requires Android app 0.3.3 or later for custom remote origins. The 0.4.6 candidate's self-signed passthrough requires the 0.4.6 app with remote CA pinning; the published 0.4.5 app and earlier builds cannot use that entry. Older supported apps continue to work with LAN, cpolar, and Tailscale.

## Manual deployment vs automatic deployment

- **Manual deployment**: copy the restricted template from the panel. Save the frps section as `/etc/dsh-mobile/frps.toml`, save the Caddy snippet as `/etc/caddy/dsh-mobile-dsh.caddy`, and add exactly this line to the main Caddyfile: `import /etc/caddy/dsh-mobile-dsh.caddy`. If the Caddyfile does not exist, create one containing only that line. Copying the template changes nothing by itself. Public IPv4 mode also requires the Certbot steps in the template because Caddy cannot issue an IP certificate; domain mode is automatic.
- **Automatic deployment**: enter an SSH user, port, and local private-key path (leave the path empty to use ssh-agent or SSH configuration), then select the one-click deployment action. The VPS must run Ubuntu or Debian with systemd. Only key-based login is accepted; passwords are not supported.

Before deployment, the panel lists every VPS change. It installs Caddy from its official APT source; public IPv4 mode additionally installs a Python virtual environment, Certbot, and the renewal timer. It creates or reuses the `dsh-mobile` system user, the frps service and configuration, the Caddy snippet and one import line, and—when UFW is active—allows the FRP control port plus 80/tcp and 443/tcp. **Your existing Caddy content is never merged or overwritten**: an existing DSH Mobile import is only normalized to one line; another non-empty configuration stops the deployment and asks you to add the import manually.

## Verify the host keys every time

Automatic deployment and one-click cleanup read the VPS host keys before opening an authenticated SSH connection:

1. Select deployment or cleanup. The panel shows the current `KEYTYPE SHA256:…` fingerprints.
2. Compare every fingerprint with the VPS provider console or the information supplied when the server was created.
3. Continue only when every key matches. Cancel when a key cannot be verified. The plugin never accepts an unknown host key silently, and a key change during the operation aborts it.

The SSH user, port, and private-key path are kept only in this browser's `localStorage` under `dsh-mobile.frp-vps-form.v1` for convenience. The shared token never enters `localStorage`, and the private-key file is never uploaded.

## Clean up the VPS

The local **Remove FRP completely** action removes only the computer's managed frpc, token, and configuration; it does not touch the VPS. Server cleanup has two equivalent paths, and both remove only DSH Mobile-owned files, services, and tagged firewall rules:

1. **Copy the uninstall script**: select **Copy VPS uninstall script**, review it, and run it as root on the VPS. The script stops and removes the frps service and certificate-renewal timer, deletes DSH Mobile configuration, binaries, certificates, and the Caddy snippet, removes the import line from the main Caddyfile while preserving your content, and removes UFW rules carrying the DSH Mobile marker. It deletes the `dsh-mobile` system user only when this deployment created it; an existing user is kept and reported.
2. **One-click cleanup**: select **Remove DSH Mobile from the VPS**. The panel verifies the host keys again and runs the same script over pinned SSH after confirmation.

Public IPv4 mode also removes the corresponding Let's Encrypt IP certificate. Domain-mode certificates remain managed by Caddy.

## Operations and troubleshooting

On the VPS:

```bash
sudo systemctl status dsh-mobile-frps.service caddy dsh-mobile-cert-renew.timer
sudo journalctl -u dsh-mobile-frps.service -u caddy -n 200 --no-pager
sudo ss -lntp
curl -vk https://PUBLIC_HOST/
```

On the computer, start with the plugin log at `$DSH_HOME/mobile-access/logs/dsh-mobile.log` (JSONL, 5 MB rotation, tokens and keys redacted) and the panel diagnostic report. Windows antivirus software can quarantine frpc; if it does, create the smallest possible exception for the verified component directory only.

## Limits

- An unregistered domain on a mainland-China VPS may be intercepted by the cloud provider; use public IPv4 mode in that case.
- An IPv4 certificate is short-lived; keep its renewal timer and Caddy service running.
- SSH form values are browser-profile state. Changing browsers or clearing site data requires entering them again; private keys and passwords are never stored.
- VPS SSH targets currently cannot use IPv6.
- The frps plaintext vhost must bind to `127.0.0.1`. The plugin rejects a publicly reachable plaintext port and reports readiness only after public discovery identifies the current computer.

## Manual end-to-end checklist (before release)

- [x] Ubuntu IP mode: one-click redeploy on a VPS → public IPv4 ready → App discovery returned this computer (2026-09-03, Tencent Cloud).
- [ ] Ubuntu domain mode: fresh VPS deployment → public domain ready → App pairing → send and receive messages.
- [x] Existing Caddy coexistence: deploy into a Caddyfile containing an existing site and import line; verify user content is byte-for-byte preserved, the import occurs exactly once, and validation passes (2026-09-03, Tencent Cloud; concurrent writes use `flock`).
- [x] Host-key change abort: an unconfirmed key set stops deployment/cleanup with `vps_host_key_mismatch` before network authentication (unit-test coverage plus full device fingerprint review).
- [x] One-click cleanup: after deployment, services, files, timers, marked firewall rules, the owned system user, and the LE certificate were removed while the user's Caddy installation remained (2026-09-03, Tencent Cloud).
- [x] Uninstall-script review: only DSH Mobile-owned paths and rules are touched (unit assertions plus device review).
